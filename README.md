# CS50x CryptoPlus

This was my final project when completing CS50x back in 2014. 
It is a simple website that allows a user to perform encryption of text using symmetric secret key ciphers.

Supported forms of encryption and decryption include:
* Atbash
* Beaufort
* Caesar
* Mixed Alphabet
* Vigenere

It can also perform cryptographic hashes leveraging the [CryptoJS](https://github.com/sytelus/CryptoJS) library:
* MD5
* SHA-1
* SHA-2 (SHA-256, SHA-512)
* SHA-3

A video of it in operation can be found at: [https://youtu.be/gh1LhD_goqQ](https://youtu.be/gh1LhD_goqQ)
